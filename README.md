# Bone Strength in the Diversity Outbred
This project contains scripts used in our Diversity Outbred project, currently published as a **[preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.169839v1)**.<br><br>
Check out the data on our **[QTL viewer](http://qtlviewer.uvadcos.io)**. You can also download an RData file here which contains Mouse phenotypes and allele probabilities.<br><br>
Sequencing data is available on GEO:

  * **[RNA-seq data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE152708)**
  * **[Single-cell RNA-seq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE152806)**
  
Go to **[analysis_pipeline](/doc/analysis_pipeline.md)** for the analysis pipeline.<br>
<br>Please contact **Basel Al-Barghouthi** (bma8ne AT virginia DOT edu) or **Charles Farber** (crf2s AT virginia DOT edu) with any questions, or for any data.<br>
<br>Folders are as follows:
<ul>
<li>/bin/ contains scripts that I got from other people</li><br>
<li>/data/contains raw data. For the most part, this is a read-only file (some exceptions).</li>
<ul><br>
<li>/data/GIGAMUGA/ contains raw data pertaining to the GigaMUGA genotyping. Some writing has been done to this.</li>
<li>/data/pheno_data/ contains phenotypic data files.</li>
</ul><br>      
<li>/doc/ contains documents.</li><br> 
<li>/results/ contains output from the analyses described. A bit messy but:</li>
<ul><br>
<li>/results/flat/ contains flat file outputs (.txt, .csv, etc).</li>
<li>/results/GIGAMUGA/ contains output pertaining to the genotyping.</li>
<li>/results/Rdata contains .Rdata and .Rds output.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
